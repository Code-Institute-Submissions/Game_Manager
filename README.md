Game Manager

This project is for me in particular to remeber what video games i own and what i personally think of them.
It is easy to use and has many features avaiable that can be used to have quick access to the different games.


I wanted to be able to have a quick and easy look at what games i own and which ones i thought very highly off.
It neednt to have a rating systesm so i could quickly see what i thought of the game.


Testing

To test the project i filled it in with many of my favourite games and titles that i own. Using all the features avaiable that i had implemented.
